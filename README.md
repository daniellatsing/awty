# Are We There Yet?
Remember when you were a kid on a long car ride, and you kept asking your parents "Are we there yet?" and annoying the heck out of them? We want an application that does exactly that.
In this part, we will just pop Toast asking the question; in a future part, we will wire it up against SMS so that you can annoy the heck out of somebody else over text messages.

In this part, instead of popping Toast, send an SMS message to the target phone number

### Stories
- As a user, when I "Start" the service, it should begin to "send messages" every N minutes, as given by the user in the EditText UI. These should be sent as SMS messages.

### Grading
- Continue to build in the 'awty' repo 
- Create a Git branch called 'part-2'; do the new work on that branch 
- We will clone the 'part-2' branch and build it 
- 5 points for the one story

### Extra Credit
- [ ] send an audio message (doesn't need to be recorded on the device; it can be a static asset)

- [ ] send a video message (ditto--can be a static asset)
